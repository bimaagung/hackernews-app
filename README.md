## HackerNews App

The HackerNews App is a web application built with Laravel. It provides a user-friendly interface to browse, read, and interact with news articles from the HackerNews platform. The app utilizes the HackerNews API to fetch and display the latest news stories, along with their associated comments and discussions.

## Documentation: Integration of Laravel Framework and Golang Service

This documentation provides an overview of how the HackerNews application integrates the Laravel framework with a Golang service for data processing. The integration is done using the HTTPS protocol, and the Golang service implements caching to enhance the retrieval of data from the HackerNews API.

### Architecture Overview

The HackerNews application follows a microservices architecture, with the frontend built using Laravel and the data processing handled by a Golang service. Here's an overview of the integration:

1. The Laravel application serves as the user interface, providing a user-friendly interface to browse, read, and interact with HackerNews articles and discussions.

2. When a user interacts with the application, Laravel sends requests to the Golang service for data processing. These requests include fetching top stories, story, comments from the HackerNews API.

3. The Golang service acts as a middleware between the Laravel application and the HackerNews API. It handles the communication with the API, performs data processing tasks, and caches the retrieved data.

4. To enhance performance, the Golang service implements caching using a caching mechanism such as Memcached. This caching layer helps speed up data retrieval from the HackerNews API by storing frequently accessed data locally.

5. The Golang service retrieves data from the HackerNews API and stores it in the cache. Subsequent requests for the same data can be served directly from the cache, reducing the response time and the load on the HackerNews API.

6. The Golang service then sends the processed data back to the Laravel application, which renders it for display to the user.

### Integration Steps

To integrate the Laravel framework with the Golang service, follow these steps:

1. Set up the Laravel application by following the installation instructions provided in the previous section. Make sure the Laravel application is configured to communicate with the Golang service via HTTPS.

2. Set up the Golang service by cloning the repository from [https://github.com/bimaagung/hackernews-service.git](https://github.com/bimaagung/hackernews-service.git).

3. Configure the Golang service to connect to the HackerNews API. Update the necessary configuration files with the API credentials and endpoints.

4. Implement the caching mechanism in the Golang service using a caching library like Memcached. Configure the caching options according to your preferences and requirements.

5. Integrate the Golang service into the Laravel application by making HTTP requests to the Golang service for data processing. Use the appropriate endpoints and payloads as defined in the Golang service's API documentation.

6. Handle the responses from the Golang service in the Laravel application and render the data to the user interface.
